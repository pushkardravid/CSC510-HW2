# Game of Life Ruby Simulation

### Pre-requisites
 - Install Go. Instructions can be found [here](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Running the code

 - Clone this repository and navigate to the `\go` directory
 - Run the ruby simulation using this command

      ```
      go run .\src\gameOfLife.go
      ```
 - The code will ask for the following inputs: 
      
     - Number of generations to simulate 
     - Number of rows in the grid
     - Number of columns in the grid
   
These values should be entered as a single space seperated string. For example, `40 40 100`
