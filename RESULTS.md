# CSC510 Homework 3

## Observations from the Game of Life debugging sessions.

### Methods

* The Game of life was implemented in three languages Ruby, Julia and Go.
* For the ease of testing the code we have used repl which avoids the testers from installing all the requirements locally.
* we have provided the testers with repl link which contains the respective code for each language in the corresponding folders and documentation for each of these programs can be found by visiting their respective directories.
* After each debugging session the testers are provided with a survey form to fill, to know more about the experience of the debbuging session.
* the time taken by each tester to debug is logged manually.

### Observations 

*For Ruby*

Observations noted based on the time taken by a person for debugging the ruby code.

Average amount of time taken: 11.7 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 7 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 17 minutes

*For Julia*

Observations noted based on the time taken by a person for debugging the julia code.

Average amount of time taken: 12.67 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 7 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 20 minutes

*For Go*

Observations noted based on the time taken by a person for debugging the go code.

Average amount of time taken: 10.7 minutes

Minimum amount of time taken: 5 minutes

Maximum amount of time taken: 15 minutes

Comparison of all languages

Average amount of time taken for go : 10.7 minutes

Average amount of time taken for ruby : 11.7 minutes

Average amount of time takenfor julia: 12.67 minutes



### Conclusions

* As we can see the average time taken to debug Go was lesser compared to ruby and julia.
* from the responses we got from the survey form, people felt a bit diffcult to debug julia compared to go and ruby.
* based on these data we can say go is best language to work on in terms of ease of understanding the code and debugging with ruby being the second best followed by julia.

## Threads to Validation

* Around 5 out of 10 testers have already worked with Go before which might have created a bias towards Go.
* Half the testers have worked with ruby as well which might be a reason for the current standings with Go being the best follwed by ruby and julia.
* the original working version of the code was accesible to all the testers, which means they might have already had a look at the code and the bugs.
* since the sessions were conducted one after ther might be a chance of that the solutions were passed from one to another.

## Material

* the survey form which we used to collect data can be [found here](https://pushkardravid.typeform.com/to/Hbzlbpvu)
* the responses from the survey form can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HUypAfMVKERYp1nnGI3mDJJdnR4YY5uuhC1JUFLXnU4/edit?usp=sharing)
* we have used repl for running the programs.
* we used Zoom for the debugging sessions.
