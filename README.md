# CSC510 Homework 2

## Game of Life Implementation

We have created a simulation for Conway's [Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in 3 different programming languages in an attempt to study the ease and the ability to debug of one language over another. 

The languages chosen for this study are [Ruby](https://github.com/pushkardravid/CSC510-HW2/blob/master/ruby), [Go](https://github.com/pushkardravid/CSC510-HW2/blob/master/go), and [Julia](https://github.com/pushkardravid/CSC510-HW2/blob/master/julia). Documentation for each of these programs can be found by visiting their respective directories.

Steps to run the program:
