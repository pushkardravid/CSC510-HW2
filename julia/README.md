# Game of Life Julia Simulation

### Pre-requisites
 - Install julia. Instructions can be found [here](https://julialang.org)

### Running the code

 - Clone this repository and navigate to the `\julia` directory
 - Run the julia simulation using this command

      ```
      julia gol.jl
      ```
 - The code will ask for the following inputs: 
      
     - Number of rows in the grid
     - Number of columns in the grid
     - Number of generations to simulate
   
These values should be entered as integers

### Output
